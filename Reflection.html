        <h1>Member 1's Reflection</h1>
        <p>
            In this assignment, I was able to use my previous proficiency in concept ideation and usability testing to contribute to the group. The outline of the rough idea I came up with was able to integrate the many technologies we were researching in assignment 2. Due to this, the final project proposal is very ambitious and unrealistic for our present level of knowledge. Despite that, I think this idea will work in the long term, as it’s a business idea that would work in real life. It was surprising to find out that no existing products in the market solve this problem as effectively as our idea. Other than that, I learned a lot from working with this team. It was the first time I collaborate with members of the IT field, yet we managed to function and brief each other on technical tasks in a way that can provide clarity to members from various disciplines. Moreover, the tasks were divided well based on the strengths of each member, resulting in higher-quality work. I will apply this method of task division based on individual members of my future teams.

            For the group assessment, there are various things that I learned for utilizing knowledge efficiently of previous topic information on how to use HTML for creating a basic website by uploading to GitHub with command line in our IT project, finding appropriate documents in the school’s library. Through the process of researching for the project, I learned that in the IT world there are many areas that I had not explored with the lack of many related skills, and there is a long way to go in the next semester to meet the requirements of employers for the ideal job. With regard to teamwork, I had imagined what it would be like to work as a team for my first semester at university which I had to learn and respected a lot from other members' feedback for my working assignments. Despite the fact that there were still many disagreements between me and other group members, in the end, we had found common ground so that I could sympathize in-depth and respected other strengths and weaknesses better. The key point is that if we work under cooperation, initiative and respect for each other, the project will be productive and quickly succeed under the common goal.

        <h1>Member 3's Reflection</h1>
        <p>
            After working as a team in 2 assignments, our group has shown great performance so far. Each member of the team has participated with the best efforts, we all came up with interesting ideas and worked together to choose the most suitable idea for the project. From my point of view, the task of working on a team allowed me to gain a great deal of valuable knowledge as well as understanding about the basic principles underlying information technology. Throughout the course of this project, I have gained the knowledge necessary to generate ideas and apply concepts in order to make the goals more attainable. In addition, I have been given the chance to exercise my knowledge of Git by converting regular text to code language or by altering Windows files using Git. Both of these activities have been quite beneficial. In spite of the fact that when individuals are studying information technology, in general, they do not communicate with each other as much, I was astonished to find out that cooperation is still highly vital for this project since we need to share information in order to keep our work balanced. In conclusion, we are still very happy with the results of our project, and I believe that if we were to turn this idea into a company, we would have a lot of success with it.

        <h1>Member 4's Reflection</h1>
        <p>
            As a group, I think that our group has worked excellently well together on this assignment, each member has done and contributed accordingly to the part they were assigned, and as a group, we all provided ideas and worked together to build and develop toward the big project.  Personally, this assignment and previous ones have taught me a substantial amount of valuable information about concepts and problems revolving around the IT world. Throughout this project, I also learned a basic understanding of HTML and Git, such as using HTML code to construct and design a simple website to then publish and access it using GitHub, or handling and modifying files with Git. Surprisingly, I discovered a lot about working as a team that I did not expect to learn while studying IT, like how to effectively work together and come to a common understanding when there is a disagreement, or balancing time between personal work and group work. Finally, even though our group ideas and concepts are pretty unique, our plan to implement advanced and complicated technology such as Natural language processing (NLP) and cloud severing makes the project seem unrealistic and unachievable, still with enough time and resources, I think that our project could happen and we could bring a beneficial and innovative product into the IT world.

        <h1>Group Reflection</h1>
        <p>
            In general, almost everything went smoothly from initializing the project ideas, preparing group meetings for project implementation and exchange, dividing tasks according to the strengths and interests of the members on a specific timetable. Therefore, the project was completed on time and was temporarily acceptable due to the fact that some members were busy with their personal work and had to push a lot to try to finish by other members. Thus, causing the tasks to be arranged later to affect the project schedule and be rushed on the deadline. That was the lesson everyone must be aware of for the improvement of group projects next semester. What we liked the most was to come up with an interesting idea about an intelligent alarm clock robot which we found many exploitable points in the project. The deeper we dug into the project, the more we discovered that there is much more to be done in reality for the project because there are numerous shortcomings like fees, safety problems, affecting multiple residences in the same destination. But in the end, we were still very proud of this project and very pleased to cooperate with people in many different majors and attitudes to work together on projects. We even joked that maybe after finishing university with nearly enough knowledge, we could join hands to set up our own company so that we could meet again and develop this potential project together. For each member, it was a memorable experience with this collaboration towards a common goal in this project.
