        <h1>Topic </h1>
        <p>With technology advancing at a breakneck pace in all industries today, businesses are racing to discover who can develop and adopt the latest and most advanced ideas into their organisation. Focusing primarily on technologies such as artificial and virtual reality, as well as artificial intelligence with machine learning and natural language processing, as a group, we want to tackle less popular themes and explore the previously established field of robotics. While robotics organisations strive to build complex robots that can behave like humans, our group intends to create a more down-to-earth and easily accessible sort of robot using an intelligent alarm clock robot. Our concept is to develop and build a robot that forces the user to be more active while waking up; the robot will wander around to prevent the user from turning it off until they catch it, at which it will switch off.</p>
        <h1>Motivation</h1>
        <p>For our motivation for this project, we believe that traditional alarm clocks are less effective at waking their user up, which might cause potential inconveniences or health problems for the users. It is stated that ’80% of adults use an alarm clock during the week to start their day, however, only one in seven wake up feeling rested daily’ (‘Alarm Clock: Is There a Better Way to Wake Up?’ n.d.). Because of how easy it is to turn off traditional alarm clocks, people tend to turn them off and continue sleeping, which might cause them to miss key appointments or feel fatigued from oversleeping. Furthermore, as this concept is not mainly focused on and developed in the IT world, with most similar products being toys, we aim to create a more advanced and interactive product with different modes and functions. With our concept of an intelligent alarm clock robot that users must chase around to turn off, not only can the user get some morning exercise, but the action of chasing, combined with the loud sound from the robot, can awaken the user's senses and relieve the fatigue of waking up in the morning.</p>
        <h1>Landscape</h1>
        <p>Even though there are products with similar concepts to our projects, most are being produced as toys with similar looks, while still acting like a traditional alarm clock without any advanced functions and modes. As most households are looking to become smarter, modern alarm clocks are built with this idea in mind, with them having smart features revolving around the user’s quality of life for instant alarm clocks that connect to your house and phone to sync the light and sound for better user comfort. Our robot alarm clock uses a more effective and robust approach to being an alarm clock, with its primary purpose of waking the user up. With our alarm clock equipped with loud sounds and motions to chase around, we feel it is a more efficient way to wake our consumers up.</p>
